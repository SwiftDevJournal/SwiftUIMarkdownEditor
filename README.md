# SwiftUIMarkdownEditor

A Markdown editor with live preview written with SwiftUI that runs on both iOS and Mac. This project demonstrates the following aspects of SwiftUI development:

* Creating a document-based SwiftUI project
* Creating a SwiftUI project that runs on both iOS and Mac
* Working with `WKWebView` in a SwiftUI app

This project requires Xcode 12.2+. The iOS app runs on iOS 14+. The Mac app runs on macOS 11+.

The project uses the [Ink Markdown parser](https://github.com/JohnSundell/Ink) written by John Sundell to translate the Markdown to the HTML that appears in the web view.
